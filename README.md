Project Purpose: To ultimately find the most important factor in determining the probabilities of any real estate being sold as well as other extraneous
factors leading to the final sale price of a given piece of real estate. This project is intended for those who want insights into the real 
estate market for either personal or practical purposes. For example, one might have an occupation as a real-estate agent and wants to know 
the market's preferences based on a quantitative approach.
